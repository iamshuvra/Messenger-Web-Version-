### Impact of This Project

The world is becoming smaller and smaller day by day because of the global village. By using this application, any user will be able to connect with their friends and family anytime. It has much privacy that they will be able to send their important information via this application. The users will be able to send any types of files, emoji and so on. They can find new friends which will enhance their networking and for the privacy issue, they will be able to block other users.

### Limitations and Possible Future Improvements

The time period for this project is very short. So it has many limitations and scopes for future improvements. First of all, here we haven't added the video calling system which will be implemented in the near future. We haven't used artificial intelligence here which will be added to cope up with the future. And we are planning to add my story/day, a news feed, chatbot and so on. And day by day, the privacy of the users will be enhancing.
